# JUCE Documentation MCP Server - Development Notes

Development History and Technical Details

## Project Genesis

The project started with the following prompt in Cursor while editing
a fresh clone of the [MCP Template](https://github.com/josmithiii/mcp-template.git):

> I want to create an MCP server which provides an API for retrieving C++ class documentation for the JUCE Framework, using this URL for the lookups:
> https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/juce_modules/index.html<br/>
> For example, documentation for the ValueTree class can be accessed as<br/>
> https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/juce_modules/classValueTree.html

That's it!  (However, the template includes a couple of important files that guide the generation.)

## Architecture Overview

The key components of the project are:

1. **juce-docs.ts**: Contains utility functions for fetching and parsing JUCE documentation from the Stanford CCRMA website.
   - Handles HTML parsing and markdown conversion
   - Manages class list fetching and caching
   - Provides search functionality

2. **index.ts**: The main MCP server implementation that exposes:
   - Resources (`juce://class/{className}`, `juce://classes`)
   - Tools (`search-classes`, `get-class-docs`)
   - Prompts (`explore-juce`)

3. **test-client.ts**: A test client that verifies the server functionality
   - Tests resource endpoints
   - Tests tool invocations
   - Tests prompt handling

## Implementation Notes

### HTML Parsing Strategy

The server parses Doxygen-generated HTML documentation:
1. Class list is extracted from the annotated list page
2. Individual class pages are parsed for detailed documentation
3. HTML is converted to markdown for better display in LLM clients

### Caching

- Class list is cached in memory during server runtime
- Individual class documentation is fetched on demand
- No persistent caching between server restarts (currently)

### Error Handling Strategy

The server implements robust error handling:
1. Network request timeouts and retries
2. Invalid class name validation
3. HTML parsing error recovery
4. Clear error messages for client display

## Development Workflow

1. Make changes to source files
2. Run `npm run dev` for development with auto-recompilation
3. Test changes using the test client
4. Build with `npm run build` for production

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements to consider:

1. Persistent caching of documentation
2. Support for method-level documentation lookup
3. Integration with other documentation sources
4. Enhanced search capabilities (e.g., method search)
5. Support for code examples and snippets

## Project Status Summary

The MCP server is working correctly and provides:

1. Access to JUCE Framework C++ class documentation
2. Resources for retrieving specific class documentation
3. Tools for searching and exploring classes
4. A prompt for guided framework exploration
5. Verified functionality through test client

The server successfully makes JUCE documentation directly accessible from LLM applications, enhancing the development workflow when working with the JUCE Framework.
